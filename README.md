This is my "working" repository for using Python.  This repository will contain Python notebooks and scripts that I will use to explore using Python for data analysis and programming.

If I perform any work in Python that will end up on my blog [Just A Data Geek](https://justadatageek.blogspot.com/), that will end up in my blog repository and will be noted as Python code to avoid mixing up with my R code.
